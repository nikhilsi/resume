**CTO — VP Engineering — Builder of products, teams & organizations that ship**

---

## About

I build technology organizations that ship — whether that means stabilizing what's broken or scaling what's working. 25+ products across PE-backed startups and Fortune 500s.

I've done this at Expedia, T-Mobile, Microsoft, Imperative, Tour Guy. The pattern: inherit complexity, earn trust, ship product, leave it better than I found it.

**Recent highlights:**
- **$45M annual savings** — Led VRBO integration into Expedia's lodging platform
- **300% ARR growth** — Scaled Imperative from $1M to $4M ARR
- **400% operational efficiency** — Built AI-powered travel platform at Tour Guy

I hire smart people, remove obstacles, and focus on delivery over status meetings. That's how teams ship.

## What I'm Building

### [TourGraph](https://github.com/nikhilsi/tourgraph) · [tourgraph.ai](https://tourgraph.ai)
A zero-friction tour discovery site and iOS app that makes people smile using the world's tour data. Four features — Tour Roulette (random weighted spins), Right Now Somewhere (golden-hour tours happening now), The World's Most (daily superlatives), and Six Degrees of Anywhere (thematic city chains). 136,000+ tours across 3,380 destinations, AI-generated one-liners, shareable OG preview cards for every tour. Built on direct experience as CTO at The Tour Guy. Next.js, SwiftUI, SQLite, Claude API, Viator Partner API.

### [ScreenTrades.ai](https://screentrades.ai) · [screentrades.ai](https://screentrades.ai)
AI-powered trading analysis platform that reduces stock research from 30–60 minutes to seconds. Aggregates 20+ real-time data APIs and delivers BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendations with confidence scores, entry/exit points, and transparent reasoning. React, FastAPI, Claude AI. 20 iterations shipped in 6 months.

### [Recurate](https://github.com/nikhilsi/recurate) · [recurate.ai](https://recurate.ai)

No new platform to learn, no API keys, no subscription. Works on claude.ai and ChatGPT today. WXT, Preact, TypeScript, zero backend.
