18 Products. I have led, built, architected and evangelized 18 engaging user centric and B2B platform products over the last 25 years. All World-class, cutting-edge technology, built with love and passion that delight customers at scale. 

I have rich experience ranging from running my own startups to large companies such as Microsoft, AT&T and Digital Equipment. My journey has enabled me to work deeply across various industry verticals â€“ employee engagement and wellbeing, communities, travel, location-based gaming, ecommerce, green energy, insurance and education. 

As an Engineering Leader and a Product Management executive, I am involved every day in different aspects of converting ideas to products that delight customers, defining strategy and vision, working through critical decision making, experimenting with new and emerging technologies and above all, building great teams. 

I have a keen focus on measuring and continuously improving product impact and enhancing the consumer experiences. I have been able to build these scalable enterprise, web, and API products through these 3 core guiding principles:
1.	Hire the right people to build the right product using the right process
2.	Do more with less. Keep design and product architecture simple and extensible 
3.	Listen to customer input and feedback, be data driven and monitor metrics

I have led teams from 2 people to 200 people. I have been very lucky and fortunate to work with extremely talented and purpose driven folks through the years and have over 100+ recommendations from peers, managers, reports, customers and vendors.

It would be my pleasure and honor to lead the engineering teams at your organization. I strongly encourage you to take a look at my LinkedIn profile recommendations from my past team members. I feel it speaks a ton about my leadership style, technical acumen, positive energy and nature. 

To summarize, I am a purpose driven leader with over 25 years of experience in scaling products, engineering and devops organizations. My core strengths include collaboratively defining the vision, driving strategic planning around it and building and growing organizations to deliver on those strategic initiatives.
