**CTO — VP Engineering — Builder of products, teams & organizations that ship**

---

## About

I build technology organizations that ship — whether that means stabilizing what's broken or scaling what's working. 25+ products across PE-backed startups and Fortune 500s.

I've done this at Expedia, T-Mobile, Microsoft, Imperative, Tour Guy. The pattern: inherit complexity, earn trust, ship product, leave it better than I found it.

**Recent highlights:**
- **$45M annual savings** — Led VRBO integration into Expedia's lodging platform
- **300% ARR growth** — Scaled Imperative from $1M to $4M ARR
- **400% operational efficiency** — Built AI-powered travel platform at Tour Guy

I hire smart people, remove obstacles, and focus on delivery over status meetings. That's how teams ship.
